# Ansible
Ansible is a powerful tool that is especially useful in remote configuration management of all compute resources that form your infrastructure.
Using machine groups within an inventory file, one can apply specific configurations to the target group of machines that need this configuration.
Together with the 'machine groups', Ansible uses an hierarchical arrangement of 'playbooks' 'roles' and 'tasks' to apply complex configurations of OS settings, services enablement and configration, middleware installation, and application installation on a target cluster of systems. Rightly done, Ansible automates the rollout of an entire application-cluster simply, repeatedly, error-free.
